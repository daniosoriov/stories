example_story = """
Once upon a time, in a small, cozy house, lived a child named Sam. Sam loved playing in their big, green backyard. 
It was filled with tall trees, colorful flowers, and soft grass. Everyday after breakfast, Sam would run outside to 
explore and discover new things.

One sunny morning, while Sam was exploring the garden, they heard a soft chirp near the bushes. Sam carefully peeked 
through the leaves and found a little bird. The bird had a hurt wing and couldn't fly.

Sam's heart filled with compassion, and they gently said, "Oh no, little bird, your wing is hurt. Let me help you." 
Sam went inside the house and asked their mom for a shoebox to make the bird a comfy, safe home.

Their mom listened carefully and lovingly helped Sam prepare the shoebox with soft, clean cloth inside. "Make sure 
the bird has some water and plant-based food, like seeds or berries," she advised. Sam nodded and thanked their mom.

Sam carefully placed the little bird in the shoebox and set it in a quiet spot underneath the tree. They brought 
fresh water in a small lid and searched the garden for some seeds and ripe berries.

For several days, Sam took care of the bird in the box. They made sure the bird had enough water, seeds, and berries 
to eat, while also giving the bird space to rest and feel safe.

One morning, as Sam checked on the little bird, they noticed that its wing seemed much better. The bird looked eager 
to stretch and try to fly again. Sam gently said, "Little bird, I think you're ready to fly again. 
Let's try it outside."

With a big, excited smile, Sam carried the shoebox outside. They gently opened the box, stepped back, and softly 
whispered, "You can do it, little bird. I believe in you."

The bird stretched its wings, feeling strong and healthy again, and with a grateful chirp, it flew up, up, up 
into the sky. Sam watched as the little bird soared high and disappeared among the trees.

Sam knew they would miss the little bird, but they felt happy knowing they had helped a friend in need. From 
that day on, every time they heard a bird's melodious song, Sam would remember their sweet little 
visitor and the love they shared.
